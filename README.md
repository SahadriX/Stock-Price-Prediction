# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data using the **Linear Regression** algorithm. It is a simple yet effective approach to understand how machine learning can be applied in financial forecasting.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

The goal is to analyze stock price data, extract meaningful patterns, and predict the future closing price of a stock. This is achieved using a supervised learning regression model â€” specifically, **Linear Regression**.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Seaborn (optional for visualization)**

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used consists of historical stock price data, typically containing:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

You can use any publicly available dataset like from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## ðŸ§® How the Model Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
2. **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features like 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Volume' to predict 'Close'.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Fitting a linear regression model on the training data.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation**: Predicting on test data and evaluating with metrics like RMSE or RÂ² score.
6. **Visualization**: Plotting actual vs. predicted prices.
